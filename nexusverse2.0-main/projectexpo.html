        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            The Project Expo begins with an initial registration phase, during which students submit their personal details and confirm their participation. Each participating team must consist of a maximum of 3 members, ensuring a balanced distribution of tasks and collaboration. Once registration is complete, teams receive guidance on event requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the day of the event, participants arrive early to set up their project displays at designated booths. Each display area is equipped with basic necessities like tables, power outlets, and any additional resources requested in advance. A team of volunteers is available to assist participants with setup to ensure each project is presented professionally and efficiently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As the event commences, participants present their projects to a panel of judges and an audience that includes students, faculty, and external visitors. Each project is allotted a specific time for presentation, where participants explain their project’s objectives, technical details, and potential real-world applications. Attendees are encouraged to engage with the presenters, ask questions, and provide feedback, fostering an interactive and collaborative environment.
